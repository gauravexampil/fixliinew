      Fixlii Fees
      FEES INCURRED BY SERVICE PROFESSIONALS
      Joining Fixlii, opening an Account, posting Services, and viewing posted Services is free. Fixlii reserves the right at its sole discretion to charge fees to Service Professionals for other services that Fixlii may provide in the future.
      Fixlii may also in certain categories require Service Professionals to make payments for following up on job leads, i.e., requests posted by Service Users, and permitting the Service Professional to contact the Service User (“Lead Fee”) irrespective of whether the job leads eventually result in a transaction or exchange of consideration for the service requested. In order to be eligible to make such Lead Fee payment, Service Professionals shall be required to make advance payments (“Credits”) from which the Lead Fee may be deducted as and when necessary. Whenever the Credits fall below the prescribed threshold, the Service Professional shall be prompted to refill the Credits in order to continue enjoying the ability to follow up on leads and contacting Service Users.
      The service professional is entitled to a refund of credits that is credited back in their wallet in the following conditions:
      Refunds are processed only when a customer has cancelled the request and not viewed your profile.
      Refunds are processed if the customer has not viewed the quote and not cancelled the request four days after your response.
      
      In the event that (i) the job lead is identified to be non-genuine, or (ii) the Service User within 48 hours of posting a request on the Website withdraws the same by way of the Website or the mobile application only, or (iii) the Service Professional pays the Lead Fee to respond to the Service User’s request for service but the Service User does not open or access the Service Professional’s response, the Lead Fee shall be reimbursed to the Service Professional. The decision of Fixlii pertaining to the above shall be final and binding.
      Fixlii offers premium services to Service Professionals for a fee and may in the future offer additional services, like tax preparation and bookkeeping that Service Professionals can also choose to purchase. Fixlii reserves the right to charge fees for these services at its sole discretion.
      FEES INCURRED BY SERVICE USERS
      Joining Fixlii, opening an Account, viewing posted Services, and bidding on posted Services is free. Fixlii currently does not charge Service Users for transactions completed on the Website between Service Users and Services Professionals. However, Fixlii reserves the right to charge a fee to Service Users in the future on a per-transaction basis or in any other manner and reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion.
      Changes to this Fee Policy are effective after Fixlii has provided you with thirty (30) days' notice by posting the changes on the Website.
      If applicable, you agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account based on Fixlii's fees, charges, and billing terms then in effect. If you do not pay on time or if Fixlii cannot charge your credit card, any payment gateway or other payment method for any reason, Fixlii reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Website and Account and terminate these Terms of Use. You are expressly agreeing that Fixlii is permitted to bill you for the applicable fees, any applicable tax, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of this Website, and the fees will be billed to your credit card, a payment gateway, or other payment method designated at the time you make a purchase or register for a fee-based service. If you cancel your Account at any time, you will not receive any refund. If you have a balance due on any account, you agree that Fixlii may charge such unpaid fees to your credit card or otherwise bill you for such unpaid fees. Fixlii reserves its right to initiate appropriate legal proceedings, if necessary, in its sole discretion, to recover such outstanding amounts.
      TAXES
      You understand that we are acting solely as an intermediary for the collection of rents and fees between a Service User and a Service Professional who choose to enter into an Agreement for Service. Because state and local tax laws vary significantly by locality, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your own tax reporting requirements in consultation with tax advisors, and that we cannot and do not offer tax advice to either hosts or guests. Further, you understand that Fixlii shall not be responsible or liable in any manner in relation to tax liability of a Service User or a Service Professional.
      
      REFUND POLICY
      All commissions payable to Fixlii by Service Professionals on consummated transactions, i.e., exchange of services for consideration, are final and non-refundable.
      All money paid by Service Professionals in the form of “Credits” are non-interest bearing and shall be refunded to the Service Professionals if they remain unutilized for a period greater than 364 days only. Such amounts shall not be refunded prior to that. If poor customer service or inappropriate behavior with customers results in the professional being de-listed from the Fixlii Partner platform, then all credits (purchased or promotional) will have to be forfeited, and there will be no refund made in such a case.
      Negotiation of Terms of Service; Disputes Between Registered Users
      
      NEGOTIATION WORKSHEET AND CONTRACT TEMPLATE
      As a courtesy to Registered Users, to facilitate the negotiation and confirmation of the Agreement for Service, Fixlii provides a general framework for negotiating the terms of Service (e.g., rate) ("Negotiation Worksheet"). Registered Users acknowledge and agree that (i) they are solely responsible for addressing all issues that exist now or may arise in the future in connection with the applicable Service; and (ii) it is solely up to such Registered Users, if they so desire, to enter into a signed, written contract that addresses all of the relevant issues and memorializes the agreed-upon Negotiation Worksheet.
      You should not rely on any information or resources contained on the Website, including, without limitation, the Negotiation Worksheet, as a replacement or substitute for any professional, financial, legal, or other advice or counsel. Fixlii makes no representations and warranties, and expressly disclaims any and all liability concerning actions taken by a user following the information or using the resources offered or provided on or through the Websites, including, without limitation, the Negotiation Worksheet. In no way will Fixlii be responsible for any actions taken or not taken based on the information or resources provided on this Website. If you have a situation that requires professional advice, you should consult a qualified specialist. Do not disregard, avoid, or delay obtaining professional advice from a qualified specialist because of information or resources that are provided on this Website, however provided.
      FIXLII IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY SERVICE CONTRACT
      Each Registered User hereby acknowledges and agrees that Fixlii is NOT a party to any oral or written Agreement for Service, Negotiation Worksheet, or any contract entered into between Registered Users in connection with any Service offered, directly or indirectly, through the Website. Each Registered User acknowledges, agrees, and understands that Fixlii only seeks to provide a platform wherein the Service User and Service Professional can be brought together, and Fixlii itself has no role in the execution or provision of Services.
      NO AGENCY OR PARTNERSHIP
      No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of the Terms of Use or your use of any part of the Website, including without limitation, the
      
      Negotiation Worksheet or Agreement for Service. You do not have any authority whatsoever to bind Fixlii in any respect. All Service Professionals are independent contractors. Neither Fixlii nor any users of the Website may direct or control the
      day-to-day activities of the other or create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other.
      DISPUTES BETWEEN REGISTERED USERS
      Subject to the provisions regarding disputes between Website participants in connection with Feedback, your interactions with individuals and/or organizations found on or through the Website, including payment of and performance of any Service, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such transactions or dealings, are solely between you and such individual or organization. You should take reasonable precautions and make whatever investigation or inquiries you deem necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any third party, including without limitation, service professionals and Service Users. You understand that deciding whether to use the Services of a Service Professional or provide Services to a Service User or use information contained in any Submitted Content, including, without limitation, Postings, Offers, Wants, and/or Feedback, is your personal decision for which alone you are responsible. You understand that Fixlii does not warrant and cannot make representations as to the suitability of any individual you may decide to interact with on or through the Website and/or the accuracy or suitability of any advice, information, or recommendations made by any individual. While Fixlii may attempt to seek information about the background of a Service Professional, either via a telephonic or in-person interview, review of past work/customer feedback, and/or check presence online (if available) on Facebook, personalized website, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., you understand that Service Professionals may register themselves suo moto. You also understand that any so-called background check undertaken by Fixlii is not exhaustive to the extent to determine previous criminal antecedents and hence, at the end of the day, the Service User should take an informed decision on his/her own accord and keep in mind the fact that Fixlii only seeks to provide a platform wherein Service Users and Service Professionals have an opportunity to meet each other.
      NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU AGREE THAT SINCE FIXLII only seeks to
      provide a platform wherein the Service User and Service Professional can be brought together and Fixlii itself has no role in the execution or provision of Services, FIXLII SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT WHATSOEVER INCURRED AS THE RESULT OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTION OR DEALINGS. IF THERE IS A DISPUTE BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS ON THE WEBSITE, OR BETWEEN REGISTERED USERS OR ANY WEBSITE USER AND ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT FIXLII IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO BECOME INVOLVED. IN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN YOU AND ONE OR MORE WEBSITE USERS, REGISTERED USERS, OR ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU HEREBY RELEASE FIXLII, ITS OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, AGENTS, AND SUCCESSORS IN RIGHTS FROM ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES
      
      (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND OR NATURE, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO SUCH DISPUTES AND/OR THE WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICE PROVIDED THEREUNDER.
