      BOOKINGS
      
      
        Orders: The Platform permits you to request various Pro Services at a time of your choosing based on available slots. To make a booking, you should follow the instructions on the Platform and provide necessary information. Fixlii uses reasonable efforts to enable you to find a Service Professional who is able to provide that service at the requested time. If, in the unlikely event, we cannot find a Service Professional for the specific timeslot, we will contact you to find an alternative time.
      
        Confirmation: Once you place a request, Fixlii will provide confirmation of the booking via SMS, email, or a push notification. Once your booking has been confirmed, you will be required to make the payment in accordance with these Terms or as indicated on the Platform. Once a Service Professional has been identified for the requested Pro Services, you shall receive confirmation in-app or via SMS, email, or a push notification.
      
      
        Cancellations: Bookings that are cancelled before confirmation on the Platform will not be charged. Fixlii’s cancellation policy sets out applicable cancellation fees.
      
      
        Substitution: In case of the unavailability of, or cancellation by a selected Service Professional, we will offer you a substitute of the Service Professional from among our registered Service Professionals.
      
      
      PRICING, FEES, AND PAYMENT TERMS
      
      
        Fixlii reserves the right to charge you for the different Services you may avail and/or for any other facilities you may opt for, from time to time, on or via the Platform.
      
      
      Charges and Fees in respect of Pro Services:
      
      
        In respect of Pro Services that you seek to avail through the Platform, you shall be required to pay Service Professionals the amount indicated at the time of booking as well as amounts towards (a) any additional Pro Services you may avail, (b) out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Service Professional, and (c) expenses arising out of the purchase of goods required or utilized for the performance of the Pro Service (“Charges”). In addition to the Charges payable to Service Professionals, Fixlii reserves the right to charge you a convenience fee for facilitating the booking and transferring payments to the Service Professional (this fee is referred to as “Fees”). You acknowledge that the final bill you receive may include additional charges, including, without limitation, a safety fee, warranty fee, insurance fee, or Service Professional welfare fee.
      
        Fixlii shall notify you of the applicable Charges, Fees, and payment methods at the time of booking. Generally, you may make payments for Pro Services through credit cards, debit cards, net banking, wallets, UPI, or cash upon completion of the Pro Service. Fixlii reserves the right to modify and otherwise restrict the modes of payment available to you. You acknowledge that certain payment methods, such as cash upon completion, may not always be available to you as a payment method. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event you pay through the method of ‘cash upon completion,’ you acknowledge that you will be required to pay both Charges and Fees to the Service Professional.
      
      
        The Charges and Fees may be payable at the time of making a booking, or upon the completion of the Pro Service, as specified by Fixlii.
      
      
        For the avoidance of doubt, please note that the Charges are payable to Service Professionals, and Fixlii acts as a limited collection agent on behalf of such Service Professionals to collect and transfer amounts due to them.
      
      
      Taxes: All Charges and Fees are inclusive of applicable taxes.
      
      
        Fixlii reserves the right to reasonably amend the Charges and Fees at any time at its sole discretion. A change in Fees shall not impact any bookings that have been confirmed before the publication of the revised Fees on the Platform.
      
      
        Charges and Fees that you pay are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Fixlii or required by the applicable laws. Under certain laws, you may be entitled to a refund or other remedies for a failure in the provision of the Services.
      
      
        You acknowledge and agree that Charges and Fees applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Fixlii will use reasonable efforts to inform you of the Charges and Fees that may apply. However, by using the Pro Services or Services, you will be responsible for the Charges and Fees incurred
      
      under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or Fees.
      
      
        Payment Processors: Fixlii may use a third-party payment processor (“Payment Processor”) to bill you through your selected mode of payment. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms and policies of such Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Fixlii shall not be liable for any error of the Payment Processor. In the event of any unsuccessful payment, the money debited shall be credited in accordance with the terms of the Payment Processor.
      
      
        Cancellation: You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Service Professional at any time prior to such Service Professional’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee in accordance with Fixlii's cancellation policy. Fixlii reserves the right to charge you, or otherwise deduct applicable taxes in respect of such cancellation fee.
      
      
        Subscriptions: Fixlii may, from time to time, offer subscription packages (howsoever named) for monetary consideration. The packages shall provide Customers with additional benefits, which may include the ability to avail discounted Pro Services. You agree that subscription packages (howsoever named) shall be subject to additional terms and conditions. You acknowledge that such subscription packages will be subject to additional terms and conditions that will be deemed to be an integral part of these Terms.
      
      
        Fixlii does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Service Professional. Any representation by Fixlii to the effect that tipping is 'voluntary', 'not required', and/or 'included' in the payments you make for Pro Services is not intended to suggest that Fixlii provides any additional payments to Service Professionals. You understand and agree that while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Service Professional who provides you with Pro Services, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.
      
      
      CUSTOMER CONDUCT
      
      
        Fixlii prohibits discrimination against Service Professionals, including on the basis of race, religion, caste, national origin, disability, sexual orientation,
      
      sex, marital status, gender identity, age, or any other characteristic that may be protected under applicable law. Such discrimination includes but is not limited to any refusal to accept Pro Services based on any of these characteristics.
      
      
        We request that you treat all Service Professionals with courtesy and respect, and that you provide them with a safe, clean, and appropriate location to perform the Pro Services. Service Professionals shall be entitled to refuse to perform Pro Services if you have not provided a safe, clean, and appropriate location for them, or you behave towards them in a manner which is discourteous, disrespectful, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate. We reserve the right to withhold access to the Services and otherwise limit your access to Pro Services at our absolute discretion if you behave towards any Service Professional in a manner which is discourteous, disrespectful, or abusive, or which we otherwise deem to be inappropriate or unlawful.
      
      
        You agree that you will be liable for discriminating against Service Professionals or for any failure, intentional or otherwise, to provide the Service Professionals a safe, clean, and appropriate location for them to perform the Pro Services. Additionally, you will also disclose any and all information that may have a bearing on the ability of the Service Professional to perform the Pro Services or impact the Services Professional’s health, safety, or well-being, to Fixlii and the Service Professional.
      
      
        You agree that in the event a Service Professional behaves in a manner that is discourteous, disrespectful, abusive, inappropriate, or in violation of the law, you shall be required to report such incident to grievanceoﬃcer@fixlii.in at the earliest but in any event within 48 (forty eight) hours of such incident.
      
      
      THIRD PARTY SERVICES
      
      
        The Platform may include services, content, documents, and information owned by, licensed to, or otherwise made available by a third party (“Third Party Services”) and contain links to Third Party Services.
